            Hello and welcome to my website. I'm a software engineer who writes about software. I've
            written {numberWithCommas(words)} words
            across <Link href="/articles">{allPostsData.length} articles</Link> on
            this <a href={siteConfig.REPO_URL}>open source</a> website. These
            articles have reached the front page of Hacker

            I've worked at Vercel since 2021, mostly on the distributed build pipeline that runs untrusted customer code, as well as on the underlying ephemeral compute platform.

            I enjoy understanding how things work and making them faster. Like how SIMD can make some programs <Link href="/counting-words-at-simd-speed">orders of magnitude quicker</Link>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wrote <Link href="/maybe-the-fastest-disk-usage-program-on-macos">one of the fastest disk-usage programs on macOS</Link> by
            using macOS-specific system calls, and then
            made it faster by <Link href="/optimizing-my-disk-usage-program">reducing thread scheduling overhead and lock contention</Link>. I
            also showed how to beat the performance of <code>grep</code> by just <Link href="/beating-grep-with-go">using goroutines</Link>.

            My <Link href="/installing-npm-packages-very-quickly">experimental package manager</Link> uses simple concurrency patterns to be faster than every package manager aside from Bun (which is 11% faster) when cold-installing from a lockfile.

            I've created a few small programming languages and related tools, including a <Link href="/compiling-a-forth"> Forth compiler</Link>, a <Link href="/lisp-to-javascript-compiler">Lisp-to-JavaScript compiler</Link>, which I turned into an <Link href="/lisp-compiler-optimizations">optimizing compiler</Link>, and for which I wrote a <Link href="/compiling-lisp-to-bytecode-and-running-it">bytecode VM</Link>.
            I also built an <Link href="/adding-for-loops-to-an-interpreter">interpreted language</Link> with a C-style syntax, which I <Link href="/profiling-and-optimizing-an-interpreter">profiled and made faster</Link>; I later added a <Link href="/a-custom-webassembly-compiler">WebAssembly compiler</Link> and a <Link href="/adding-a-line-profiler-to-my-language">line profiler</Link>. I also <Link href="/porting-boolrule-to-rust">ported an expression engine</Link> to Rust.

            I really enjoy games (chess, scrabble, sudoku), puzzles, and solvers. I built my <Link href="/building-my-own-chess-engine">own chess engine</Link>, and created visualizations for understanding <Link href="/visualizing-chess-bitboards">how bitboards can be used to store chess game state</Link>. I wrote about <Link href="/building-game-prototypes-with-love">building game prototypes in Lua</Link>, how to <Link href="/2d-multiplayer-from-scratch">build 2D multiplayer from scratch</Link>, a daily puzzle game I designed called <Link href="/how-i-made-queuedle">Queuedle</Link>, a <Link href="/solving-queuedle">solver for it</Link>, and some <Link href="/generating-mazes">maze generation algorithms</Link>.

            I'm a big fan of classic FPS games like Quake and Counter-Strike.

            I did a <Link href="/my-time-at-the-recurse-center">six-week batch at the Recurse Center</Link> where I worked on many projects and paired with many excellent programmers. One of the projects I worked on was a text editor that I <Link href="/making-a-text-editor-with-a-game-engine">built using a game engine</Link>, and to which I <Link href="/implementing-highlighting-search-and-undo">added highlighting, search, and undo</Link>.

            I've written about <Link href="/sandboxing-javascript-code">how to sandbox JavaScript</Link> using Deno, how to <Link href="/running-untrusted-python-code">sandbox Python using seccomp</Link>, and how to take over the <code>getrandom</code> system call <Link href="/making-python-less-random">using ptrace</Link>.

            I'd like to write more about AI. I recently created <Link href="/filesystem-backed-by-an-llm">a FUSE filesystem where file operations are handled by an LLM</Link>.

            Technical books I recommend include <i>Crafting Interpreters</i> and <i>The Computational Beauty of Nature</i>. For general fiction, I recommend the authors Patricia Lockwood and Ben Lerner. For sci-fi, I recommend the <i>Dune</i> series (1-6 are amazing, 7-9 are good) and the <i>Remembrance of Earth's Past</i> trilogy. For non-fiction, I recommend <i>The Orchid Thief</i> and <i>Nothing to Envy</i>.
