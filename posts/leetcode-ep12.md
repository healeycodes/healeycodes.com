Today we're doing 'Saturday Morning Coffee' solutions -- instead of '10pm Work Night' solutions!

Continuing with the streak of string-based problems, all of the code here is 'optimal' -- i.e., *~97th* percentile or higher in the rankings.

## [953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/)

Problem: Given the `order` of an alien alphabet, are these given alien `words` ordered lexiographically?

I started with a naive solution to this, which was to iterate `order` into a Dictionary for fast character look-up. I then compared the given list against a `sorted()` version of itself. I.e., `return words == sorted(words, key=some lambda)`. I wasn't happy with the runtime and I was wasting space -- `sorted` creates an addtional list in memory. Also, the function being passed to the lambda converted every word to a numerical list -- more created space, more complexity.

I then tested using a list of `[None] * 26` to use as a look-up 'Dictionary' by converting the ASCII letters to their numerical values but it was actually slower than using a normal Dictionary which was surprising. So, the Dictionary had to stay.

My improvement was to use a compare function, letter by letter, so that no extra space was created. In some cases only the first letter of each word needed to be checked -- instead of converting each whole word.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isAlienSorted(self, words, order):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :type order: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        
        # fast char-value checking
        vals = dict()
        for idx, val in enumerate(order):
            vals[val] = idx
        
        
        for i in range(0, len(words)-1):
            w1, w2 = words[i], words[i+1]
            flag = 0
            
            for j in range(min(len(w1), len(w2))):
                if vals[w1[j]] < vals[w2[j]]:
                    # w1 is winner
                    flag = 1
                    break
                elif vals[w1[j]] > vals[w2[j]]:
                    # w2 is winner
                    return False

            # w1 and w2 have equal comparable chars
            if flag != 1:
                if len(w1) > len(w2):
                    return False
        
        return True
```

This is one of my fastest and cleanest solutions yet.

`Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 100.00% of Python online submissions for Verifying an Alien Dictionary.`

Runtime complexity: `O(n)`.

Spacetime complexity: Assuming an `order` of 26: `O(1)`.

## [917. Reverse Only Letters](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-only-letters/)

Problem: Reverse the letters in string `S` leaving all other characters in place.

I used a simple 'two pointer' solution to this, similar to a version that I used for *345. Reverse Vowels of a String*.

```python
from string import ascii_letters
class Solution(object):
    def reverseOnlyLetters(self, S):
        """
        :type S: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        S = list(S)
        letters = set(ascii_letters)
        start = 0
        end = len(S)-1
        while not start > end:
            if S[start] not in letters:
                start += 1
                continue
            if S[end] not in letters:
                end -= 1
                continue
            S[start], S[end] = S[end], S[start]
            start += 1
            end -= 1
        return ''.join(S)
```

After researching, and checking the runtime percentile (~97th), I believe this to be the most optimal Python solution to this problem.

Runtime complexity: `O(n)`.

Space complexity: `O(1)`.

## [844. Backspace String Compare](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/)

Problem: Given string `S` and `T`, are they equal when written in a text editor when `#` is backspace?

One of my early solutions was creating two lists, e.g., `[None] * len(S)`, but I realised that this wasn't optimal and may create more space than required.

I reached for `deque` -- Python's implementation of a Double Ended Queue. With backspace equalling a `pop()` the rest was pretty straight forward. 

```python
from collections import deque
class Solution(object):
    def backspaceCompare(self, S, T):
        """
        :type S: str
        :type T: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        s = deque()
        for i in S:
            if i == '#':
                if len(s) > 0:
                    s.pop()
                else:
                    continue
            else:
                s.append(i)
            
        t = deque()
        for i in T:
            if i == '#':
                if len(t) > 0:
                    t.pop()
                else:
                    continue
            else:
                t.append(i)

        return s == t
```

I saw a faster solution to this problem that doesn't use any data structures. Instead it uses while loops and a lot of checking. It's about twice as many lines of code as mine and, while impressive, is incredibly hard to parse!
