After warming up (literally, I cycled home in *frosty* weather) I tackled some more Leetcode problems today.

## [961. N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-repeated-element-in-size-2n-array/submissions/)

Problem: Given an list `A` of size `2N`, there are `N+1` unique elements -- which one is repeated `N` times?

For this solution I used the high performance Counter that I discovered in my previous blog post.

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def repeatedNTimes(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        counter = set()
        half = len(A) / 2

        for i in A:
            counter[i] += 1
            if counter[i] == half:

                return i
```

This solution has a runtime complexity of `O(n)` and a space complexity of `O(n)`. I'm not sure whether this can be improved upon. All elements of the list need to be checked because it is unsorted -- we can't know where our `N` element will be.

Leetcode's tests for this problem only have unique elements and so a Set is technically faster but I prefer my solution as it's more 'correct' per the problem statement.

## [965. Univalued Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/univalued-binary-tree/submissions/)

Problem: Are all the values of this binary tree the same?

It's a tree-traversal problem so it's either going to be Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search. I chose DFS.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def isUnivalTree(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        value = root.val
        
        def recursive_search(node):
            if node == None:
                return True
            elif node.val != value:
                return False
            else:
                return recursive_search(node.left) and recursive_search(node.right)
            return True
        
        return recursive_search(root)
```

Whatever the solution to this problem, the runtime complexity will be `O(n)` as every node must be touched to satisfy the problem condition. We used DFS so the stack will only hold one singular winding tree-root in memory at once. Hence the space complexity is `O(d)` where `d` is the depth of the tree.

## [804. Unique Morse Code Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-morse-code-words/)

Problem: Given a list of lowercase words, how many unique morse code sequences are there?

They're looking for unique occurrences so a standard optimization is likely to be a Set.

```python
class Solution:
    def uniqueMorseRepresentations(self, words):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        morse = [".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]

        unique_words = set()
        
        for word in words:
            as_morse = []
            for c in word:
                as_morse.append(morse[ord(c) - 97])
            unique_words.add(''.join(as_morse))

        return len(unique_words)
```

My solution has a runtime complexity of `O(n)` with a space complexity of `O(n)`. Similar to Leetcode problem 709, it may be faster to use a Dictionary that maps letters to morse as opposed to performing a calculation for each letter but this may depend on language implementation.

After looking through other peoples' Python solutions, I noted that for the future I need to focus on using more Python language features. For instance, I saw lines like:

`code = ''.join([morseTable[ord(letter) - 97] for letter in list(word)])`.

Lines like this are more terse while remaining understandable.
